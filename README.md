# MethodOf

A crude, probably not very good implementation of the pseudo-intrinsic `methodof` commonly seen in decompilers.

It is much like `typeof` but instead of inputting a type, you input a method. For an example, see [the test program](https://github.com/EtiTheSpirit/MethodOf/blob/master/MethodOfTest/Program.cs)
